Jarvis Chatbot â€“ Virutal Assistant Using javaScript

Jarvis is an AI-virtual assistant, just like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant. This project that uses the JavaScript advance concept with the feature of converting text to speech and then using the natural language processing method to help understand Jarvis, what the client is asking for, and then providing the web search result to the user. We have just created a prototype for this project as of now, but there is a lot of scope for this project. In the future, we can add multiple features to our Jarvis virtual assistant project.
